## Approach Taken
I started my app by checking out existing apps related to my app. Search for a suitable API, explore the API in depth. Understand the relationships between the various functions, create appropriate components and the relationship between them.
## Wins and Blockers
### Wins

I enjoyed get to know with new libraries for use and experiment with new techniques.
### Blockers
If I were to make the app again I would give myself more time to create a responsive app.
Add search exercises by categories. 
Display data in a graph.
